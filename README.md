# traymondbiz's miniventure fork
A personal Java playground using Markus Persson's LD22 entry, "Minicraft" which is essentially a bite-sized, 2D version of Minecraft.

It's interesting due to its usage of standard Java, allowing any who hops in to see the fundamentals at play, without having to worry about learning external libraries.

"Miniventure" is a series of contributions by PlayMinicraft which introduces a large number of code comments to help developers and enthusiasts understand what's under the hood. A secondary roadmap item to colorize sprites and separate them into their own files was cancelled.
